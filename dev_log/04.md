I don't know how or why but, I am reinterested in this project.
Yesterday I spent a small amount of time writing the game loop and a test that verifies the correct 3 functions of that loop are called.
Today, I updated that game loop to stop when the user types quit. I also added a sleep.

Now that I am finished with this work, I realize that the early stage of this project will be discrete chunks. A benefit of which is I can share this with others.

1. Create a function for the game loop.
 - it should get user input, update the universe, render the universe
2. Write a test that validates the game loop does the correct steps.
3. Next stutter the game loop. Add a sleep.
4. Next, enable the user to quit.
