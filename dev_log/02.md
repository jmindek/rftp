Much time has passed since my last work on this project.
Between then and now I have been reading about GenServer.
Today, I implemented the Universe as a GenServer. 
It is not a thought out implementation.
It represents my desire to continue working the project and the desire to continue exploring Elixir.

As I write this, I am wondering if there is a running copy of TradeWars somewhere on the web??
Oh too cool, it is here https://classicreload.com/trade-wars-2002.html
