I'm continuing a burst of productivity on the game.
Today I added a create\_universe and necessary supporting functions; generate_name, put\_and\_get\_planet(). Also, added test for verifying we can create a universe.

Next up I want to place the planets in the universe. I think the universe will be defined by x, y, z coords. 
Each planet will get an origin; the center of the planet is located on x, y, z in the universe.
Then the space it occupies can be computed by adding it's size to each of those coords.
I can then use that info to ensure that other planets are some minimum distance away.
