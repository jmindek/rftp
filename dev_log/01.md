### 06:30 ###

Up to this point I have 
 * the idea
 * several sheets in my 4x6 notebook of concepts
 * a directory for all the future development
 * a talk submitted for CodeMash 2019
 * little skill in Elixir
 * and, no code

The idea is simple; create a command line game where I "fly" around a universe visiting planets and doing things on those planets to acquire materials to expand my population, engineering, and power. This is based on my past experience playing Trade Wars on various BBS's in the late 80's.

Laying awake in bed at 5am this morning I had the realization that it has to be multiplayer.

So, I added a page to the notebook today that sketches out the design for the game server.
I will be working on that.
Also, I think I better find a way to play the original so that I don't rely on my weak memory of how it played.

### 20:30 update ###

Throughout the day, I mentally vascilated between sticking with the original single player app and going whole hog for the multiplayer.  
This noncommittal attitude is because I have no skill in Elixir, writing games, or writing servers.  
Well, as of this log entry I am more committed to the multiplayer version.  
Finding lots of content on the web helped to increase my confidence that I can do it.  
I will start with the nice tutorial here https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html to get a grip on the Elixir way of doing a multiuser server.
