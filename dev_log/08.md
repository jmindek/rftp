### Looking back and ahead. ###

Today I looked at the git log.
There have been 2 commits to date.
The first was Aug 1 2018. That's when this project was begun.
The second was Aug 28 2019.
What a gap!
It took over a year to get to a substantial commit.
It represents quite a bit though.
I learned about agents and genservers well enough to clumsily use these unique features of Elixir.
I learned about testing in Elixir.
I explored Enum, List, Map, and other modules.
I developed a slightly deeper understanding of mix and iex.

Besides enabling me to make that second commit, the above activities have validated my early enamourment of Elixir. 
To me it is such a expressive yet quirky language. I love how readable test output is. I love how readable most of the code is. I love (and hate at times) how magical some of the code is.
I have tons of respect and admiration for Jose V. and the others that have brought Elixir to me.
