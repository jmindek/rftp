It's my son's birthday today. I am on the bus heading to work for a half day.
Yesterday I had thoughts about planning, that is, I need more of it. I need to think through the start play process for example. Then I document that and then code it.

To date here's what's coded:
 1. universe GenServer and an "adds planets" test
 2. a game_loop
 3. a LoopUtils module with stubbed functions called in the game_loop
 
 It's not much considering when this project started.
 It's a lot though considering how much I have going on.

On bus heading home. It's a gloomy overcast day in Columbus Oh. I am listening to Tangerine Dream, one of my teen favorites. 
I am going to create my first requirements doc.
